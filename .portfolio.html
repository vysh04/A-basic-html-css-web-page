        <h1><mark> CORONAVIRUS DISEASE(COVID-19)</mark></h1>
<img src="covidimage.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="COVID-19">
<p style="color: greenyellow"> COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. 
    The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people,
     currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.

    Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the worldâ€™s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods.
     Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets.
      Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. 
      For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.</p>
